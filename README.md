🌍 Global Landslide Analysis Using Python & EDA
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global landslide occurrences using Python. Leveraging data from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog, this analysis uncovers temporal, spatial, and statistical patterns that contribute to better understanding and mitigation of landslide disasters.

🔍 Project Objectives
The following analytical tasks were performed:

Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

Handled missing values, standardized formats, and extracted features like year and location.

Landslide Frequency Analysis

Examined how landslide occurrences vary over time and identified peak years/seasons.
Impact Analysis (Fatalities & Injuries)
Evaluated the human impact by analyzing trends in fatalities and injuries over the years.

Geospatial Analysis

Visualized landslide-prone areas on global maps using latitude/longitude data to identify hotspots.

Cause & Effect Analysis

Investigated triggering factors such as rainfall, earthquakes, and construction activities and their correlation with landslide severity.

Correlation Analysis: Frequency vs. Impact

Explored the relationship between how often landslides occur and their associated human impact using scatter plots and statistical summaries.

Outlier Detection Using Z-score Method

Identified extreme cases of fatalities and injuries using Z-score-based statistical outlier detection.

📈 Visual Outputs
Time-series line plots with average trendlines

Heatmaps and scatter plots for geospatial analysis

Bar plots for causal factor impact

Gradient line plots showing frequency over time

Boxplots and Z-score outlier visuals

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas, numpy – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – visual storytelling

scipy – statistical computation

💡 Key Insights
Landslides peak during monsoon months and in mountainous regions.

Rainfall and construction are major triggers behind high-impact events.

A total of 2,987 outliers were detected using Z-score methodology.

Visual analytics help support risk prediction and climate resilience initiatives.
